## General Information
In this tutorial, we will be using a 1-Channel and a 4-Channel Solid State Relay to control a series of loads, with light bulbs being used as an example. The 1-Channel module will simply turn the load on and off at a consistent rate while the 4-Channel module will create a sequence akin to a light show.

## Hardware
* Arduino Uno
* 1-Channel Solid State Relay
* 4-Channel Solid State Relay
* Jumper Wires
* Receptacle - 4
* Extension Cord (w/ exposed copper wires) â€“ 4
* Light bulbs - 4
* Screwdriver

## Software
* Arduino
