## General Information
In this tutorial, we will be using an MPU9255 module to test its accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. The module will be tested by monitoring the module and how it reacts to movements in specific directions and proximity to sensitive areas.

## Hardware
* Arduino Uno
* MPU-9255 9DOF 9-axis Inertial MPU
* Jumper Wires

## Software
* Arduino

## Setup
