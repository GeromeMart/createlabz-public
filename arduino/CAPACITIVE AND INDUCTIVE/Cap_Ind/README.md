## General information
In this tutorial, we will be using two proximity sensor; inductive and capacitive. we will be making two basic application for
 both sensors and will be discussing its difference in terms of how they detect and work.

## Hardware needed
* Arduino Uno
* Inductive Proximity Sensor
* Capacitive Proximity Sensor
* Relay
* LED
* Jumper Cables
* Breadboard
* Buzzer

## Setup
