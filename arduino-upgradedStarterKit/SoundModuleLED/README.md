## General information
This project was created as part of the Arduino Upgraded Kit tutorials for createlabz. This is the part four of the Controlling LED series tutorial. This project utilizes music to manupulate the blinking of LEDS. This is similar to a sound spectrum visualizer. As the sound module picks up a sound, it gives a measurement on how loud it is. The minimum and maximum values obtained will be distributed to the six LEDs.

## Hardware needed
* Arduino Uno
* 220-330 ohm resistor
* Breadboard
* Sound Module
* LEDs
* Jumper Cables
