## General information
This project was created as part of the Arduino Upgraded Kit tutorials for createlabz. This is the part three of the Controlling LED series tutorial. The project uses five LEDs to indicate the value of the potentiometer and once the value reaches HIGH to VERY HIGH the buzzer will emit a sound to warn the user. This setup can also be altered with a different input.

## Hardware needed
* Arduino Uno
* 220 ohm resistor
* 1K ohm resisor
* Breadboard
* Potentiometer
* LEDs
* Buzzer
* Jumper Cables

## Setup

## Features
* Level Indicator for potentiometer value
* Buzzer to warn if value is HIGH or VERY HIGH

To-do:
* Replace potentiometer to other input components found in the Arduino kit

## Status
Project is: _finished_
