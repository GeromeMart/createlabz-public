## General information
Fire detection is very important in commercial buildings, factories, and most importantly houses. Luckily, a simple fire detection system can be made using the [Arduino Upgraded Starter Kit](https://store.createlabz.com/products/kit-04-2?_pos=1&_sid=df21431e7&_ss=r). This compilation includes the codes for testing the IR Remote and the LM35. 

## Hardware needed
* Arduino Uno
* Breadboard
* Jumper Cables
* 300K ohm resistor
* Flame Sensor
* LM35 Temperature Sensor
* RGB 3 Color Module
* Infrared Receiver
* Remote
* Buzzer

## Setup
For a detailed instruction on how to recreate this project, head on to this [blogpost](https://store.createlabz.com/blogs/createlabz-tutorials/home-fire-alarm-system-using-flame-sensor-and-lm35) .

More projects can be found in [KnowledgeBase and Tutorials](https://store.createlabz.com/blogs/createlabz-tutorials) blog.

## Features
* Makes  use of the LM35 and Flame sensor as input
* Buzzer and RGB 3 color Module as output
* Allows the reset of the alarm using remote

To-do:
* Replace components with high-scale module
* Include GSM module to send SMS alerts

## Status
Project is: _finished_
