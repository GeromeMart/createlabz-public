## General information
This project was created as part of the Arduino Upgraded Kit tutorials for createlabz. This is the part two of the Controlling LED series tutorial which automates the first tutorial. Upon using a photoresistor, there is less human intervention as compared to the potentiometer where a knob is needed to be turned.

## Hardware needed
* Arduino Uno
* 220 ohm resistor
* 10K ohm resisor
* Breadboard
* Photoresistor
* LED
* Jumper Cables

## Setup

## Features
* Learn Arduino basics
* Act as an ambient light sensor

To-do:
* Make use of the other components found on the Arduino Kit

## Status
Project is: _finished_
