## General information
This attendance system makes use of the RFID reader to identify the date and time a user enters by reading their RFID keychain or card. However, this does not log the history of the users. This project is done with the available componens from the [Arduino Upgraded Starter Kit](https://store.createlabz.com/products/kit-04-2?_pos=1&_sid=df21431e7&_ss=r). This compilation includes the code for setting up the RTC module. 

## Hardware needed
* Arduino Uno
* Breadboard
* Jumper Cables
* RFID reader 
* Keychain and Electromagnetic Card (for RFID)
* RTC Module
* RGB 3 Color Module
* Buzzer


## Setup
For a detailed instruction on how to create this project, head on to this [blogpost](https://store.createlabz.com/blogs/createlabz-tutorials/attendance-system-using-rfid-and-rtc-module) .

## Features
* Indicates wheter card holder is late or not
* Makes use of the serial port 
* Buzz when card is read

To-do:
* Include SD Card Module to log users
* Disallow the repiition of RFID cards

## Status
Project is: _finished_
